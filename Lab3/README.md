# Laboratory 3 - Pizza Ordering System 3

## Author: Maria Colta

---

## Objectives:

1.  Study and understand the Behavioral Design Patterns.

2.  As a continuation of the previous laboratory work, think about what communication between software entities might be involed in your system.

3.  Implement some additional functionalities using behavioral design patterns.

## Theory

TO DO: add text

Here are some examples of behavioral design patterns:

- **Chain of Responsibility** - lets you provide a substitute or placeholder for another object. A proxy controls access to the original object, allowing you to perform something either before or after the request gets through to the original object. [2]

- **Command** - lets you attach new behaviors to objects by placing these objects inside special wrapper objects that contain the behaviors. [2]

- **Interpreter** -

- **Iterator** -

- **Mediator** -

- **Observer** -

- **Strategy** -

## Implementation & Used Design Patterns:

The behavioural patterns which I used to continue the pizza ordering system are described below in the next subsections.

The instructions to run the project can be found here: [Run Project](#run-the-project)

### 1. Pattern 1

//

### 2. Pattern 2

## Run the project

To run the project, run the following commands:

```
cd Lab3/pizza-order-system
npm install
```

Compile the `.ts` files and run the `index.js` file:

```
npx tsc
npx ts-node dist/index.js
```

## Screenshots / Results

When running the project, we have the following output, based on the instructions from client code:
